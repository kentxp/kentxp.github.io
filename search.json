Check out https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/#cname-already-taken for more information.\"\ni am unsure which repository contains the CNAME file with your custom domain,\nwhat should I do now?\n```\n大概个把小时，github以邮件的形式通知你如何处理，我一直以为会在站内通知。\n\n```\nWe can release that domain name for you to use if you can verify your ownership of it with us. A quick way we can verify your ownership of the domain would be for you to add a TXT record to your domain.\n\nWhen you create the TXT record, please include the following value:\n\ngithub-verification=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nIf you need a name for the record, please use \"@\".\n\n......\n\nPlease let me know once you've done this so we can verify and clear that domain, or if you have any questions about this verification process.\n```\n大体的意思就是，你需要配置一条TXT记录用来证明你是这个域名的所有者，搞定了发邮件给我们，让我们知道。\n\n由于是周末，我过了2天才回复邮件\n\n很快就收到了回复\n\n```\nThanks for doing that! I've cleared that domain from it's current location. You can add it to your site by following these steps:\n......\n```\n配置好域名后，就可以通过自己的域名访问了。\n\n","tags":["GitHub Pages"]}]
